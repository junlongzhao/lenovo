he O

Long O

it O

now O

But O
Currin B-PER
who O

this O

best O
way O

the O

A O

can O
be O

but O
the O
only O
way O
one O
is O
going O

get O
to O
the O
truth O
in O
its O
totality O
is O
if O
people O

it O
is O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
go O
to O
the O

committee O
At O
the O

this O
is O
not O
the O

He O

the O

the O

through O
Twyford B-LOC
Down I-LOC
in O
the O

But O
they O
are O

campaigning O
on O

issue O
such O
as O
stopping O
the O

building O

out-of-town O
superstores O
which O
they O

create O

The O

Watts B-PER

the O

explained O
that O
Alan B-PER

reappointment O
as O

of O
the O
Federal B-ORG

and O
the O
outlook O

were O
more O
important O
than O
whether O
Rubin B-PER

at O
the O

Although O
if O
we O
did O
get O
someone O
that O
was O
seen O
as O
looking O

depreciation O
it O
would O
probably O
hurt O
capital O
flows O
to O
the O
United B-LOC

said O
Widness B-PER
adding O
that O
could O
hurt O
U.S. B-LOC
stocks O

to O
a O
lesser O
degree O
bonds O
Still O
markets O
may O
have O
little O
to O
fear O
from O
any O
Rubin B-PER
successor O
because O
the O
firm O
dollar O
policy O
has O
yielded O
positive O
results O
If O
that O
is O
true O
then O
any O
new O
Treasury B-ORG
chief O
would O
need O
to O
be O
as O
effective O
as O
Rubin B-PER

convincing O

indeed O
