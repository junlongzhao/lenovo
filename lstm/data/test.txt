Singapore B-LOC

hosting O

the O

the O

Supple B-PER
said O
the O
struggle O
that O
Singapore B-LOC
had O
to O
wage O
in O
vying O
to O
host O
the O
meeting O
would O
be O
repeated O
during O
the O
talks O
There O
is O
tension O
at O
every O
step O
of O
the O
way O
since O
a O
battle O
line O
between O
the O
West O

has O
been O
drawn O
over O
the O
issue O
of O

he O
said O
Supple B-PER
said O
hosting O
the O
meeting O
carried O
prestige O
for O
Singapore B-LOC
however O
this O
is O
quite O
intangible O
as O
the O
prestige O
factor O
may O
not O
necessarily O
lead O
to O
any O
additional O
investment O
and O
trade O
flows O
to O
this O
region O
From O
a O
commercial O
point O
of O
view O
the O
meeting O
would O
be O
good O
for O
Singapore B-LOC
's O
tourism O
industry O
Tan B-PER
said O
A O
large O
part O
of O
Singapore B-LOC
's O
workforce O
would O
be O
mobilised O
to O
ensure O
the O
meeting O
would O
run O
without O
a O
glitch O
but O
the O
average O
Singaporean B-MISC
would O
probably O
not O
be O
too O
concerned O
about O
some O
of O
the O
issues O
Tan B-PER
said O
But O
the O
more O
educated O
public O
will O
realise O
that O
these O
kind O
of O
things O
are O
important O
for O
Singapore B-LOC
as O
a O
small O
economy O
Supple B-PER
said O
any O
political O
gains O
the O
Singapore B-LOC
government O
would O
get O
from O
the O
WTO B-ORG
meeting O
ahead O
of O
a O
general O
election O
due O
by O
April O
would O
depend O
on O
how O
successful O
it O
was O
in O
pushing O
its O
economic O
agenda O
If O
there O
are O
any O
movements O
toward O
freer O
trade O
then O
Singapore B-LOC

economy O
and O
the O

would O
gain O
he O
said O
But O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
would O
be O
wise O
to O
play O
up O
the O
political O
aspect O
of O
this O
I O
