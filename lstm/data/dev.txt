when O
he O

He O

what O
I O
called O
him O
because O
of O
that O
Hill B-PER
won O

on O

that O
Jansher B-PER
was O
generally O
honest O
on O

played O
by O
the O

decision O
The O

had O
upset O
Jansher B-PER

with O
his O
mixture O
of O
gamesmanship O

fluent O
stroke-making O

I O
changed O

him O

he O
added O
He O

not O

as O
he O
used O

but O
was O
too O
good O
for O
me O
in O
the O
end O
I O
shook O
him O
a O
bit O
but O
he O
will O
come O
out O
next O
time O
and O
be O
a O
better O
player O
for O
it O
that O

Jansher O
Jansher B-PER
said O
that O
he O
was O
disturbed O
to O

What O
he O
did O
was O
bad O
for O

bad O

We O
